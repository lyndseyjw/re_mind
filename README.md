## A MERN Full Stack Wellness Application Where Users Can Track their Daily Habits & Assess Trends in Overall Well-Being

## User Story

As a user seeking a more mindful lifestyle, I want an accessible tool where I may log my daily habits so I may better understand how these correlate to my overall sense of well-being.

## Features

As we begin to adapt to our new post-COVID environment and develop new routines for self-care, we want the capability to take our well-being and happiness into our own hands and find new ways for encouragement and accountability. Additionally, we want to gain new insights on how our physical habits and mental state are intertwined, so that we can modify or improve our own behaviors as we re-integrate and begin rebuilding our communities.<br/>
<br/>
Using the re:mind app, users are able to create an account so they may log their daily habits. Once logged in, the user is presented with different prompts depending on the time of day (along with a color scheme that sets the mood for the current time). In the morning, the user is asked how many hours they slept the night before & are encouraged to set an intention for the day. They are also reminded to take a picture of something that makes them smile while living their day (the color is a warm yellow). During the day, the user is asked how many cups of water they drank, how many minutes they have engaged with another human, & how many minutes they have spent outside (the color is an invigorating green). In the evening, the user is again asked if they would like to log more cups of water & to log what they are grateful for (the color is a cool blue). Throughout the day, the user is presented with all the data they have logged so far for that day.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the day, the user can view their dashboard, where they will be presented with graphs depicting all of their datapoint entries. The graph container has multiple tabs for a clean appearance that separates data by sleep, water, social, & outside. The user is able to see how each of these data groups have changed throughout their month.</br>
<br/>
The user is also presented with a calendar that displays their month with days color-coded based on their mood ranking for each day. When the user clicks on an individual day, the user is asked to rank their overall mood that day based on three assessment tools. If the user chooses that they were happy, then the day will turn green; if they choose neutral, it will turn yellow; if they choose sad, then it will turn red. The intention is that the user is able to view their month & begin to learn how their daily habits such as amount of sleep, amount of water, social time, & outdoor time has effected their overall mood. From here, the user can begin to set priorities throughout the day so they can spend more time doing the things that make them feel great!<br/>
<br/>
Soon users will be able to upload pictures of things that make them smile throughout the day so they may view their scrapbook during times they might need motivation & encouragement.</br>
</br>
We have many exciting features in the works so stayed tuned for future developments!</br>
<br/>
We hope this application will bring all of our users joy & comfort during these challenging times.
